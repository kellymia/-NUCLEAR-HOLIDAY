# -NUCLEAR-HOLIDAY
CMPO 385 Major Project

(NUCLEAR) HOLIDAY is an attempt at a gallery installation which is a metaphor for the effects that humans have on the environment. 

The Ardiuino code is uploaded to teensy LC, which then causes it to act as a mouse, which will 
trigger the changes in the code. There is a button on the circuit that when pressed allows the
user to use the mouse as normal, so you can navigate our computer while the circuit is plugged
in. 

The files need to be served from a local directory so that these can be accessed from the
browser, from the link http://localhost:8080/index.html.
